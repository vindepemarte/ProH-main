### Implementation Strategy

1. Start with core workflow improvements (Super Worker, Super Agent, Student dashboards)
   - Implement one role's changes at a time
   - Test thoroughly before moving to next role

2. Add analytics and pricing configurations
   - Ensure database schema supports new metrics
   - Implement calculations without affecting existing functionality

3. Enhance UI components (Beta badge, Calendar, modals)
   - Make isolated UI changes that don't affect core functionality

4. Build advanced view system
   - Start with table view as foundation
   - Add other views incrementally
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing list views

5. Implement Notion-like Forms system
   - Begin with database schema design for forms and responses
   - Create basic form builder UI with essential field types
   - Implement form submission and response storage
   - Add form sharing functionality
   - Develop response viewing interfaces
   - Add advanced features incrementally

6. Add feedback and notification systems last
   - These are supplementary features that won't break core functionality

This approach ensures each feature can be implemented independently without breaking existing functionality, allowing for incremental deployment and testing.
